      <div class="mission-content">
        <p>High-performance individuals are normally faced with a choice: do I include more technological leverage in my life, or retreat for clarity of focus, clarity, and peace?</p>

        <p>We shouldn't have to make that choice.</p>

        <p>We believe technology should enhance our well-being, not diminish it. That's why we created the Shield: to help us feel the calmness and feel while out in nature, even while surrounded by electronics in the workplace.</p>

        <p>We want to do the best work of our lives,<br>
        Without sacrificing peace of our lives.<br>
        That's why we wear the Shield.</p>

        <p>Here to support you,</p>
